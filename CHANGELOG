v0.3.0
  Remove autotest discover.rb (created all sorts of conflicts)
  Added Hash with Array guard
  Added a hirrarchy printer to examples directory
  Moved Disco to be in the Stanza namespace (staves off deeply namespaced classes)
  Namespaced the DSL methods to Blather::DSL. These can be included in any object you like now. "require 'blather/client'" will still include them directly in Kernel to keep the simple one-file dsl
  Stopped doing one class per error type. This created a giant hierarchy tree that was just unnecessary. The error name is now #name. Errors can be matched with a combination of handler and guard.
  Fixed XML namespaces. Previous versions weren't actually adding the node to the namespace making xpath queries inconsistent at best.
  Added support for anonymous authentication by providing a blank node on the jid ("@[host]")

v0.2.3
  Go back to using the master branch for gems (stupid mistake)  

v0.2.2
  Switch to Jeweler.
  Move from custom libxml to just a custom push parser
  Add guards to handlers

v0.2.1 Upgrade to libxml 0.9.7

v0.2 Overhaul the DSL to look more like Sinatra

v0.1 Initial release (birth!)
